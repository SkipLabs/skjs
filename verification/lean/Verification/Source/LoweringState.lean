holds the identity of a private cell this lowering allocated: `contract` is the
stable storage type every assignment is checked against, and `reference` is the
slot's own type, interned once when the binding was declared so that building
an environment stays a pure projection.

claim about `x` describes what the cell currently holds, which is exactly what
must not become the type of the slot holding its identity. -/
