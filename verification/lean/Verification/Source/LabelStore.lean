/-! What the source path asks of the labels it types a program with, and of
the store that gives them meaning. The checked requests are written against
these two interfaces, which two stores provide: the store extraction grows
over the lowering's heads (`EquationStore.State`, labels `Tree`), and the
equations those heads present, frozen (`EquationStore.Checked`, labels
`CheckedLabel`). Neither interface carries a proof obligation: a store's graph
is what the checked requests are proved safe over, whatever store built it. -/

/-- A label, apart from any store: decidable equality and hashing (search
caches are keyed by types), a total order for the canonical order of unions,
its JSON spelling, and the four primitive values' labels, which every store
holds as they are. -/

/-- What a diagnostic shows of a store: a finite table of rows over its own
positions, the position each label the diagnostic mentions is shown at, and a
source-like spelling of the positions that stand for applications
(`Promise<number | R>`). The table holds the mentioned labels and what their
rows name, to a depth bound; past it, an application is an opaque named
reference: a `names` entry whose row has no clauses. A diagnostic is display
data: nothing checks or trusts a projection. -/

/-- What checking reads of a store: labels with rows, their graph and the
image check its instances use. `σ` is the store's state, `ι` its labels.
Rows are read through `row` and interpreted through `graph`, which must
agree with them; `valid` says which labels the store holds, `wellFormed`
that its rows name only those. `labels` lists labels with rows of their own,
and `bound` bounds any closure over rows (the vocabulary a search is offered
is such a closure). A checked request reads its store through this view
only, so a store that no longer grows (`EquationStore.Checked`) is one. -/
