/-- **A lambda's graph code.** Its code is the graph its body compiles to
(`CallCode.graph`), checked at each signature the code offers from that
signature's frame, the captures at their types here: one code request per
signature, whose certificate the unit's code table records. The captures are
the named bindings in scope the lambda reads (its defaults included); a
closure reads nothing else. Which signatures (`mode`): a function's claim, an
arrow type or a scheme row, whose binders are then parameter rows (`fn`); a
class value's construct signatures, with `undefined` for the receiver `new`
passes (`ctor`); or an annotation's arrows, a callable object's (`annotated`).
Code collecting an array rest offers its own variadic signature, at the
source's annotations, which the claim is reached from by subtyping; or a
scheme row's variadic signatures. -/
