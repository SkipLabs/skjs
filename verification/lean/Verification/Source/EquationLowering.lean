/-! Lowering source declarations to recursive equations (`verification/RECURSIVE-EQUATIONS.md`
§8). The parser's declaration document, the function tree's annotations and
the source-claims labels become one table of equations, validated by
`Equations.ofRaw`, and unions of closed labels over it. Heads are made per
source declaration, per unit and per type-literal occurrence, never per
instance, so a growing family (`Pair<[T, U]>`, `Promise`'s `catch`) is
finitely many heads. Head allocation is keyed by source occurrence and has no
instance-count cutoff. An alias cycle not guarded by a constructor is refused.
The subtype execution budget governs the subsequent declared-bound checks.

Lowering is untrusted in what it proposes (the hash-consing of literal
heads) and trusted in what it states: the equations
are the meaning of the source. The source path reads it through
`EquationLowering.source` (`SourceClaimJson.equationFront`), and the store
extraction grows is its state (`EquationStore`). -/
