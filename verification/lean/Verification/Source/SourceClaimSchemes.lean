A generic closure is graph code at a scheme row (`HasTyUsing.funScheme`): its code
is checked once, at the scheme's signatures with the scheme's binders as
parameter rows, and a table entry holds at every assignment of the parameter
rows (`ProgramCertificates.CodesSound`), so at every instantiation. Here each
generic closure's claimed scheme becomes a scheme row whose binders are fresh
value parameter rows; every claim and annotation inside the closure reads its
binders as those rows; and a call of a scheme-typed local is claimed at the
instance the call names, which the checker relates to the scheme by a checked
instance (`InstArrs`). -/
