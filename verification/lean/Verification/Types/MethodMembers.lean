/-! # Host-relative method members

A method member's contract is relative to its host: reading the member from
an object and invoking it **with that object as receiver** behaves as typed.
It promises nothing for another receiver, so a member's signatures carry no
receiver. A member may state types its host must meet (TypeScript's
`this: T` on a method): then it promises its signatures only when the host
is in each of them. This is self-application, as in Abadi and Cardelli's object
calculus, and exactly the shape method-call syntax lowers to: read the member
from the saved object, then invoke it with that object.

A member is at a location of its host whose contract implies, below the
level and in every world extending the current one, the member's signatures
with the host as the one receiver. The host is fixed when the member is read;
every field keeps its location contract, so the pair (value read, host) keeps
its contract as the world grows.

A generic method's signatures are quantified: they hold at every
instantiation of the method's binders. Such a member states them as a
**scheme**, a family of callables meeting the signatures at every instance,
which the member bound to its host meets: the forwarding function `.bind`
makes of the value read and the host, whatever receiver it is later given.
That is the same host-relative promise, read through binding, so a scheme's
own receivers are the forwarding function's and say nothing of the host. -/

finds its key: at `v`'s own location for it, or, when `v` lacks the key, where
its prototype chain has it, some prototypes up (`along`). The contract found
there implies, in every world extending the current one, the member's
signatures invoked on `v`. The implication is not claimed in unrelated
worlds: there the object's own locations need not hold their contracts, and a
method reading them could not be safe. -/
