it (DESIGN.md, the trusted tools): each witness runs the machine, or evaluates
a trusted definition, on a hand-written program and states the outcome
JavaScript gives. A pipeline case does not show these: a verified claim holds
of the model whichever way the model runs, and TypeScript admits no source
comparing a NaN with a literal, calling `null` or applying `new` to an
arrow. -/
