# The object language

The operational foundation of the stateful type development. It is compiled
and tested, and is the current verifier's language.

An untyped call-by-value calculus with a mutable heap: code objects, calls,
explicit binding, primitive values, and object allocation/read/write. Values are terms, so worlds, heaps and the
operational semantics all speak about the same objects.

An object is a finite map from field names to heap locations, fixed at
allocation. Each location still holds one value under one contract, so worlds,
heap satisfaction and the write rule are unchanged; what a field name buys is
that one object can own several of them, and that two contracts naming
different fields of the same object constrain different locations.

Substitution is written for *closed* arguments. `Bindings.lean` proves its
closing-substitution laws; `ProgramTyping.lean` ensures typed positive values
are closed. The untyped step relation itself imposes no scope check.

The step relation is small-step and total in the sense that matters: a term
that is not a value, does not throw (`Raises`) and cannot step is **stuck**,
and the safety predicate in `Safety.lean` rules that out. A throw is an
outcome, as a value is: JavaScript's exceptions are part of its meaning, and a
well-typed program may throw, never reach a wrong value.

namespace Model

/-- A property key. JavaScript keys an object's properties by strings and by
symbols, and the two spaces are disjoint: no string names a symbol-keyed
property, so a string-keyed access, and a type that constrains every string
key, never reaches one. A symbol key is the identity of a symbol value. -/
inductive PropKey where
  | str (name : String)
  | sym (id : Nat)
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- Field names written in the model are string keys. -/
instance : Coe String PropKey := ⟨PropKey.str⟩

/-- For messages only: a symbol key is shown by its identity. -/

/-- An order for sorting field maps: string keys by name, then symbol keys by
identity. -/

  | .str a, .str b => a < b
  | .str _, .sym _ => true
  | .sym _, .str _ => false
  | .sym a, .sym b => a < b

/-- The field every single-cell object of the earlier development carries. A
one-field object named this way is what `Tm.obj`, `Tm.read` and `Tm.write`
abbreviate, so every rule and proof written before field names keeps its
meaning. -/
def valueField : PropKey := "value"

/-- The key an array object holds its store under (`CallArguments.arrayStoreField`).
No source property names it, so an object owns it exactly when it is an array:
that is what `Array.isArray` tests (`Tag.isArray`). -/
def arrayStoreKey : PropKey := "[]"

/-- The shapes a value can have, and so the tests a program can make of one.
Nullishness groups null and undefined for source coalescing; the other tests
distinguish individual runtime shapes. `truthy` is JavaScript's `ToBoolean`:
false exactly for `false`, the two zeros, NaN, `""`, `0n`, `null` and
`undefined`. -/

  array does. Keys are fixed at allocation, so the answer never changes. -/

  primitive kinds that carry a value. -/

  /-- `typeof v === "object"`: `null`, or an object without call code. An
  object with call code, a class included, is `"function"` (`isFun`). -/
  | typeofObject
  /-- `key in v`: an object owning the key, or one its prototype chain
  reaches (`tagHoldsIn`). Keys are fixed at allocation and no source writes a
  prototype, so the answer never changes; which source keys this answers as
  JavaScript does is the lowering's business (`inKeyRefusal`). -/

/-- The binary operators on primitive operands, JavaScript's own (`binop`
gives their meaning). Arithmetic combines two numbers as the IEEE-754 double
operation, or two bigints as the integer one: `pow` is `**`, `xor` is `^`,
which `~x` is written with (`x ^ -1`). The relational operators compare two
numeric operands, number and bigint alike, or two strings, and answer a
Boolean. Strict equality answers a Boolean where one operand is a
primitive. A combination JavaScript throws on, or converts through anything
else, is stuck. `rem` is `%`: on doubles the exact remainder of truncating
division, with the dividend's sign; on bigints the truncating remainder. -/

code runs when the function is called (`[[Call]]`), and `construct` code only
under `new` (`[[Construct]]`), as a class constructor's does, whose plain call
throws. An arrow's or a method's code is `call`: `new` on it throws. -/

  `[[Construct]]` for a class constructor), and whether it collects a rest
  (`rest`). Invocation starts the

  `[this, parameter_0, …, parameter_{arity-1}] ++ captures`; `new` on
  construct code passes `undefined` for `this`. Code with a rest first
  collects the actuals past its `arity` fixed parameters into one fresh store,

`RangeError`). A relational operator
compares two numeric values of either kind, exactly, or two strings by their
UTF-16 code units. `+` with a string operand concatenates: the other operand,
a primitive other than a symbol, converts by `ToString` (`primString`), which
