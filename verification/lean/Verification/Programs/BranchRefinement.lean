/-! ### Refinement by an observed field

A tag observed on a value read from a field of an object excludes each label
whose record contract for that field answers the other way: the field's
location holds the read value, and its world contract, fixed at allocation,
admits only values of the field's type. The exclusion concerns the object's
label, which is timeless; what the field holds later is not claimed. -/

where it is readonly (`optT`, `SlotContract`). -/
