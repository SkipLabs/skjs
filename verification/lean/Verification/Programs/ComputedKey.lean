# Allocation at a key known only at run time

`Tm.makeKey k a` evaluates `k`, then `a`, then allocates one fresh plain
object owning one property, at the key `ToPropertyKey` gives `k`'s value
(`propertyKey`), holding `a`'s value. Its type is, for each clause of the
key's type, the object that clause's keys give (`keyedClause`): at a literal
key, the record of that one field, its keys among it; at a key of a class
(every string, every number, every symbol), the dictionary over the class,
writable at the initializer's type. A key-adding write at a key known only at
run time is the copy of the object with this allocation over it (`merge`).

The key is never one the model keeps for itself (`Unreserved`, `keyed_key`): a string
is spelled by `escapeKey`, which moves every such spelling
(`reservedSpelling_escapeKey`), a number's `ToString` begins with a digit, a
minus sign, `NaN` or `Infinity` (`numberToString_shape`), and a symbol is no
string. So the object holds no prototype and is no array, by construction.
