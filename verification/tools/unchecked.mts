/**
 * Everywhere the node side tells the compiler not to check something, found
 * with the compiler the project builds with. `tsc` has no option for any of
 * these, and `typescript-eslint` cannot check them here because it does not
 * support TypeScript 7.
 *
 * Three ways of saying it, one report:
 *
 * A written `any` is not a weaker type, it is the absence of one: the compiler
 * stops reading the expression, so a field that does not exist reads as
 * `undefined` rather than failing. That is not hypothetical here — two checks
 * on type-parameter defaults read `tp.default` through an `any` for as long as
 * they existed, and never once fired.
 *
 * An `as` says the value is something the compiler cannot see that it is, and
 * a `!` says it is there when the compiler cannot see that either. Both are
 * assertions: nothing checks them, and a decoder that establishes the fact is
 * what they stand in for.
 *
 * `as const` and `as unknown` are not counted: they assert nothing about a
 * value, the first only asking for the literal type of what is written there,
 * the second widening to the type every value has.
 *
 * Each one written must carry its reason, a comment `// asserted: REASON` at
 * the end of its line or alone on the line above: a decoder's last line, where
 * the checks it just ran become the type it returns, or an assertion whose
 * check would cost more than it guards. One without a reason is an error, and
 * the command fails.
