/** `async`, `await`, `for...of`, argument spreads, array pattern slices and
 * `for...in` as trusted steps (PROGRAM-TYPING.md, "Async functions and
 * await", "Loops and spreads over iterables", "Patterns" and "Statement
 * forms"). Each is a
 * call of an intrinsic, a value no source name can denote: the parser writes
 * the async ones, and Lean compiles a `for...of` to its calls. The declaration
 * reader lists the intrinsics among the client's values at these signatures,
 * some over the standard library's `Promise`. Nothing checks them: like an
 * imported value's declared type, each is an assumption a result is relative
 * to.
 *
 * - `await e` is `%Await%(e)`: awaiting an awaitable value yields its
 *   observation (`X.Observed`): a stably non-thenable value itself, a native
 *   promise's fulfillment value, a value of its type argument, whatever that
 *   is. Other jobs may run in between, as they may during any call.
 * - `return e` in an async function is `return %AsyncReturn%(e)`: the promise
 *   the call returned settles to the fresh resolution of `e`
 *   (`X.Result`): `e` itself where it stays non-thenable, and what `e`
 *   settles to, resolved again, where it is a native promise. The lifetime
 *   `then` contract and the ordinary array invariant establish stability
 *   alongside primitives.
 * - Completing an async function is `return %AsyncComplete%()`: its promise
 *   settles to `undefined`, which `Promise<void>` admits.
 * - `for (const x of xs)` steps the iteration intrinsic the iterable's type
 *   picks (`iterationIntrinsic`): `%Iterate%(xs)` over an array, the array's
 *   iterator, which yields `{ value }` for each element in turn, reading the
 *   array's current length at each step, and then `null`. The others step
 *   the host's iterator of a string, a `Set`, a `Map` or a host collection
 *   iterator likewise. None of these iterators has a `return`, so a loop left
 *   early calls nothing.
 * - An argument spread `...x` of one of those others is `...%Spread:K%(x)`,
 *   the fresh array of what its iterator yields (`spreadName`).
 * - An array pattern's rest that is a slice, after `k` elements, is
 *   `%RestFrom:k%(xs)` (`restFromIntrinsic`).
 * - `for (const k in o)` is `for (const k of %ForIn%(o))`: the keys the loop
 *   visits, each a string, of any value (none for null or undefined).
 * - `for (const k in P) { const x = P[k]!; … }`, where the body reads the
 *   entry at the key before anything can change it and `P` still denotes the
 *   enumerated object there (`forInEntryReads` in the parser), steps
 *   `%Iterate:ForIn%(P)` instead, and the read is the step's value: over a
 *   dictionary, which
 *   holds no prototype, the keys the loop visits are its own, and each step
 *   yields a fresh `[key, value]` array, the value the one the dictionary
 *   holds under the key at the step. A plain object's prototype,
 *   `Object.prototype`, holds no enumerable key.
 * - `k in o` whose key TypeScript types as other than string literals is
 *   `%HasProperty%(k, o)`: whether `o`, an object, has the property the key
 *   converts to, its own or an inherited one, as the host answers it. The
 *   conversion of a string, a number or a symbol runs no code, and neither
 *   does the lookup on the objects a program holds (no proxy, DESIGN.md
 *   "Trust surface"); the answer is a Boolean, which narrows nothing.
 * - `xs[k]` of an array or a tuple at a key TypeScript types as `number` (no
 *   literal) is `%ElementAt%(xs, k)`: the property the number names, an
 *   element where it is an index below the length, an own property of
 *   another numeric key, which `Array<T>`'s declared `[n: number]: T` says
 *   holds a `T`, else `undefined`, since the built-in `Array.prototype` and
 *   `Object.prototype` own no numeric key. The read runs no code (no
 *   accessor or proxy, DESIGN.md "Trust surface").
 *
 * The reviewed overlay of library globals (`library-globals.mts`) reads some
 * members as these: `Promise.resolve(v)` is `%PromiseResolve%(v)`, which
 * retains a native promise through its constructor identity path or freshly
 * resolves a stably non-thenable value: a promise of `v`'s observation, what
 * awaiting `v` yields. `Promise.resolve()` is
 * `%AsyncComplete%()`, and
 * `Promise.all(ps)` is `%PromiseAll%(ps)`: a promise of the array of what
 * the promises settle to, in order, settling once each has. The array is
 * fresh and owns no `then`, so it is not adopted. `Promise.reject(r)` is
 * `%PromiseReject%(r)`, a promise rejected with `r`, whose await throws, and
 * `new Promise(executor)` is `%NewPromise%(executor)`: the executor is
 * called at once with the promise's resolving functions, and resolving
 * settles the promise to a primitive. `Symbol.for(k)` is `%SymbolFor%(k)`,
 * the registry's symbol for the string `k`, and `Symbol.keyFor(s)` is
 * `%SymbolKeyFor%(s)`, the string the registry holds `s` under, or
 * `undefined`: neither reads its receiver, and a string or a symbol argument
 * converts without running code. */
