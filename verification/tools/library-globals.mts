/** The standard library's global values, such as `BigInt` and `Symbol`, as a
 * client may use them: TypeScript's own declarations, as the project's
 * standard library states them, through a reviewed overlay (DESIGN.md,
 * "Library globals"). Nothing is vendored. As for `Array.prototype`
 * (`array-prototype.mts`), the overlay holds only what those declarations do
 * not say and soundness needs:
 *
 * - which signatures exist: a global's call, construct, method or property
 *   signature is read only when an entry lists it, with exactly the text it
 *   was reviewed against, so a changed library is refused and reviewed again;
 * - where the host runs code of the client's on an argument the declaration
 *   admits (`String` of an object calls its `toString`), the parameter the
 *   reader states instead: the part of the declared type on which it runs
 *   none (`admit`). Where the host only throws on an argument (`BigInt(1.5)`,
 *   a `RangeError`), the declaration is read as it is: a throw is an outcome,
 *   never a wrong value (DESIGN.md, "Throws");
 * - where the declaration states less than the host does (`any`) or more (a
 *   parameter at which it misbehaves), the signature the host meets, stated
 *   instead (`stated`);
 * - a member whose call is a primitive of the calculus: a test (`test`) or
 *   a trusted step already stated as an intrinsic (`intrinsic`).
 *
 * A global declared outside the standard library, such as Node's `process`,
 * is read as its declaration states, member by member (`selectGlobal`). */
