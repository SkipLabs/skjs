 * Type stripping, for the suites that run a fragment source rather than check

 * context to observe what the program actually does, and evaluation needs the
 * annotations gone.
 *
 * Nothing here compiles: the fragment is already JavaScript once the types are
 * erased. Both runtimes this repository uses erase types themselves — bun
 * through its own transpiler, node through the same stripper it applies to a
 * `.ts` entry point — so neither a compiler nor a build step is involved.
