/**
 * An object holds both an ordinary method and an arrow. Extracting the method
 * and using .call supplies a different receiver; .call on the arrow preserves
 * its lexical capture. The result is true for either seed.
 *
 * The directive makes the code strict, the receiver rule the verifier models.
 * Both the TypeScript and the OCaml producers' claims verify. SKJS does not
 * parse the directive, so its refusal is reported with the corpus. `.call` is
 * the intrinsic here because `owner` is a `const` object literal and nothing
 * in the file writes `choose` or `read`.
