   element, which the signature binding more parameters does not state"
let value_arity_reason =
  "a value known only by its type may read the further actuals: a function with further optional or rest \
   parameters meets a shorter function type, so `(x: T) => U` may be `(x: T, y?: S) => U`, and a call \
   passing more actuals may pass `y` a value outside `S`; only a module function's own code is known to \
   discard them"

   here something may have run, so the read may miss"
let generic_instances_reason =
  "the covering rule for quantified signatures relates two members up to renaming the target's binders to \
   the source's: as many binders, of the same kinds, each target bound within the source's, and the source's \
   signatures covering the target's renamed; members binding different numbers of binders need an instance \
   table naming each source signature's image at the target's binders"

  "that type admits a call passing any receiver, and the function requires its own"
let invariance_reason =
  "a writable element or field is invariant, as a write through the wider view would break the narrower \
   one; TypeScript relates them covariantly, which is unsound, and SKJS infers the narrower from a \
   later use"
let family_test_reason =
  "the value is narrowed to that primitive family, and a tag test does not narrow a type parameter's \
   row to its meet with the family, the `T & number` of TypeScript, so it is no longer read as a `T`"

let forgotten_cell_reason =
  "a cell is known by its contract after a step that may write it (a call, whose callee may write any \
   location its operands reach, as the model states no reachability; a closure run later; a throw from \
   anywhere in a `try`)"

   a value of a type parameter may be of any kind"

   exact keys"

let exact_optional_reason =

let symbol_copy_reason =
  "the copy is stated at its string keys only, and JavaScript also copies an own enumerable \
   symbol-keyed property, so the result states no symbol key"
let copy_field_reason =
  "the copy is allocated per pair of its operands' clauses at one record, and several arms of the expected \
   union with the copy's keys type a written field apart (TypeScript types the literal per arm of the \
   contextual union), so no one record meets them all, a writable field being invariant"

let builtin_array_reason =
  "`Array.isArray` finds a `readonly unknown[]` in `unknown` or a record, which may be a tuple: its \
   positions hold different types, so no instance of the binder is its store's contract, and a callee \
   rearranging its `Array<A>` breaks the tuple's type"
let mutable_tuple_length_reason =
  "the length of a mutable tuple is not fixed by its type, since `push` is allowed on it (an unsoundness \
   of TypeScript), so its `length` is a number"
let unknown_instance_reason =
  "`x instanceof C` does not narrow `unknown` to C: an object gets C's prototype without C's constructor \
   running (`Object.create(C.prototype)`, `Object.setPrototypeOf`, `Reflect.construct` with C as the new \
   target), so C's prototype on its chain is no evidence of C's fields, and the model assumes it of no value \
   a unit receives"
